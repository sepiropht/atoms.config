Go to your project\n2. Open command pallette -> type \"Build index\" -> press enter. This won't be needed soon.\n3. With the caret on the symbol you wish to import, press ctrl+alt+m (or command \"Typescript Import - Insert\" in command line)\n4. Profit!\n\n# Notes\n- This will only work with Typescript projects that use ES6 Modules syntax\n- It only works with default exports at the moment\n- Currently you have to re-build the index (see Usage step #2) each time you add/change things. This will be fixed very soon!\n- The code is horrible, this started as small test but Atom proved to be so easy to customize I just went on hacking with a mix of JS and CS. Please wear sunglasses while looking at the code.\n- Because of the above, this is not tested at all.\n\n#Todo\n- Add example gif\n- Remove need for building index\n- Make non-default imports/exports work as well\n- Use [code-links](https://atom.io/packages/code-links) for the go-to-declaration\n- Make it work with regular CommonJS modules\n- Rewrite using Typescript\n\n#Contributing\ndokkis:\n- workspace.scan now is limited to ts and js files\n- added support for multiple export symbol in one file \n- support for non default export\n- support for interface, namespace and enum\n- added warning notification if you try to import multiple times the same symbol\n- added error notification if the plugin does not find the symbol\n- added support for numbers in the symbol definition (example ClassName1)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/GabiGrin/atom-typescript-modules-helper-plugin/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/GabiGrin/atom-typescript-modules-helper-plugin#readme","_id":"typescript-modules-helper@0.6.2","_shasum":"a73431432472d22c465c8b1d14f991be45c1bc3b","_resolved":"file:../d-116113-19859-1oihler/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116113-19859-1oihler/package.tgz"}
